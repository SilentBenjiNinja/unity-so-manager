# Scriptable Object Manager for Unity

* Uses Sirenix Odin Inspector
* Adds an attribute ```[ManageableData]``` which makes scriptable objects editable in a dedicated Odin window
* Based on a [tutorial by Sirenix on YouTube](https://youtu.be/1zu41Ku46xU)

## Setup

* Add the ```[ManageableData]``` attribute to your scriptable object class and give it a nice display name
* In the toolbar, select BNJ > SO Manager to view your scriptable objects
* Optional: Add an icon to your scriptable object script to have an easier time finding it in the SO Manager
